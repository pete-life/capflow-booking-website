The Calendar page is your daily view of all bookable timeslots across your resources.

**Location:** Sidebar > Calendar

---

## Calendar View

The default view shows an interactive calendar with all timeslots displayed as events.

### Reading the Calendar

Each timeslot block shows:
- **Time range** (e.g., 10:00–11:00)
- **Resource name**
- **Capacity indicator** (colour-coded)
- **Booking count** (e.g., "4/12 booked")

### Colour Coding

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Green** | Low occupancy — plenty of availability |
| **Yellow/Orange** | Medium occupancy — filling up |
| **Red** | High occupancy — near or at capacity |

### Switching Views

- **Day view** — Detailed hourly view for a single day
- **Week view** — Overview of the full week
- **Month view** — High-level monthly overview

### Filtering

Use the resource filter to show timeslots for a specific resource only. Useful when you have multiple resources and want to focus on one.

## Timeslot Actions

### View Details

Click any timeslot to see:
- Full capacity breakdown (total, member, public)
- Current bookings with customer names
- Booking hold count
- Override status (if capacity has been manually adjusted)

### Edit a Timeslot

From the timeslot detail view, you can:
- **Adjust capacity** — Create a one-time override for this specific slot
- **View bookings** — See all bookings for this timeslot
- **Delete** — Remove the timeslot (with booking impact warning)

### Timeslot Overrides

Sometimes you need to change capacity for a single timeslot without editing the entire schedule. Overrides let you:

- Increase capacity for a popular slot
- Decrease capacity for a day with reduced staffing
- Block a slot entirely (set capacity to 0)

Overrides only affect the specific timeslot — the schedule rules remain unchanged.

---

## Schedules Tab

Switch to the **Schedules** tab to manage Schedules — the rules that generate timeslots.

This tab shows:
- List of all schedules with their date ranges
- Visual timeline showing coverage
- Gap warnings for dates without coverage
- Create/edit/delete schedule actions

See [Schedules](/help/schedules) for a full guide.

## Bulk Operations

### Select a Range
Click and drag on empty calendar space to select a date range. This opens options for bulk actions.

### Delete Empty Timeslots
You can bulk-delete timeslots that have no bookings. Useful for cleaning up after changing your schedule.

> **Caution:** Deleting timeslots with bookings will cancel those bookings. Always check for affected bookings first.

## Tips

- **Check daily:** Make it a habit to check the calendar each morning for the day's bookings
- **Use the day view** for operational planning — it shows the most detail
- **Use the month view** to spot coverage gaps or unusually busy periods
- **Create overrides** instead of editing schedules for one-off capacity changes
- **Watch for red slots** — if they appear frequently, consider increasing capacity in your schedule rules
