## Check-in Methods

### QR Code / Token Scan

The fastest way to check in customers:

1. Open the Check-in page
2. Scan the customer's QR code or enter their check-in token
3. The booking is immediately marked as checked in

Every booking has a unique check-in token included in the confirmation email. Customers can show the QR code from their email on their phone.

### Manual Check-in

If the customer doesn't have their QR code:

1. Find them in the **Today's Arrivals** list
2. Click the **Check In** button next to their booking
3. Done

You can search by:
- Email address
- Booking ID
- Check-in token

## Today's Dashboard

The Check-in page shows a real-time dashboard for today:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Bookings** | All confirmed bookings for today |
| **Checked In** | How many have arrived |
| **Awaiting** | Still expected to arrive |
| **Check-in Rate** | Percentage checked in |
| **Total Guests** | Sum of all party sizes |

---

## Filtering the Arrivals List

- **Resource filter** — Show only bookings for a specific resource
- **Hide checked-in** — Toggle to show only customers still awaiting arrival
- **Search** — Find specific customers by email or booking ID

---

## Undo Check-in

Made a mistake? You can undo a check-in:

1. Find the checked-in booking
2. Click **Undo Check-in**
3. The booking returns to "awaiting" status

---

## No-Shows

At the end of the day, customers who didn't show up can be marked as no-shows:

1. Find the unchecked-in booking
2. Mark as **No-Show**
3. For members, the no-show fee is added to their fee account

> **Tip:** Wait until after the session has started before marking no-shows — late arrivals happen.

- **Use QR scanning** when possible — it's the fastest and most reliable method
