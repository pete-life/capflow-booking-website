Before diving into the details, here's a quick reference for the core concepts in CapFlow.

## Core Concepts

### Resource

A physical capacity unit at your venue. Examples: "Studio A", "Main Wall", "Court 1", "Pool Lane 1".

Resources are the foundation of scheduling — each timeslot belongs to one resource. If two activities share the same physical space and capacity limit, they should be the same resource.

### Service

A bookable offering that customers see on your storefront. Each service is linked to:
- A **Resource** (where the activity happens)
- A **Shopify Product** (for pricing and checkout)

Example: "Group Yoga" is a service linked to the "Studio A" resource and a Shopify product with price variants.

### Timeslot

A specific time block when customers can book. Timeslots have:
- A start and end time
- A resource they belong to
- Capacity limits (how many people can book)

Timeslots are usually auto-generated by Schedules, not created manually.

### Schedule

A date range with weekly schedule rules that auto-generate timeslots. Instead of creating hundreds of timeslots by hand, you define "every Monday–Friday, 10:00–18:00, hourly sessions" and CapFlow creates all the timeslots for you.

### Booking

A confirmed customer reservation for one or more timeslots. Bookings track:
- Customer info (from Shopify)
- Party size (number of people)
- Check-in status
- Which capacity pool was used (member or public)

### Booking Hold

A temporary reservation (10-minute TTL) created when a customer starts the checkout process. Holds prevent double-booking while the customer completes payment. If the hold expires without confirmation, the capacity is released.

### Block Booking

A staff-created booking that blocks capacity without a customer. Used for maintenance, private events, staff training, or any time you need to reduce available capacity.

## Capacity Concepts

### Capacity Pool

Each timeslot has parallel capacity buckets:

| Pool | Who can book | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Total** | Hard maximum for the timeslot | 12 people |
| **Members** | Reserved for members with pool access | 4 people |
| **Public** | Available for anyone (public/walk-in) | 8 people |

Total is usually the sum of Members + Public, but doesn't have to be.

### Pool Release

A mechanism that opens unused member capacity to the public as the timeslot approaches. If member slots haven't been booked X hours before the session, they become available to everyone.

Example: "Release 24 hours before" — if 2 of 4 member slots are unused 24 hours before the session, those 2 slots become available to public customers.

### Occupancy

The percentage of total capacity that's been booked. Shown throughout the app as colour-coded indicators:
- **Green**: Low occupancy (plenty of availability)
- **Yellow/Orange**: Medium occupancy
- **Red**: Near or at capacity

## Membership Concepts

### Membership Type

A configurable definition of a membership tier. Each type has a display label, a Shopify tag for customer syncing, and settings for pool access and weekday restrictions. You configure your membership types in **Settings > Membership Types**.

### Entitlement

A customer's membership rights. Common types include:
- **Annual Pass (Full)** — Full access for a year (or configured duration)
- **Annual Pass (Weekday)** — Weekday-only member access (Mon–Fri); weekends at regular pricing
- **Monthly Pass** — Full access for a month
- **Clip Card** — Pre-paid credits (clips) for individual sessions

You can create custom membership types beyond these defaults. Entitlements are created automatically when a customer purchases the corresponding Shopify product.

### Clip

A pre-paid credit unit. Customers buy a clip card (e.g., 10 clips) and spend clips to book sessions. Clips are refunded if a booking is cancelled within the free cancellation window.

### Fee Account

A running balance of fees owed by a customer. Fees are added for:
- Late cancellations (within the fee window)
- No-shows (checked by staff)

Fees are tracked but not auto-charged — you collect them separately.

## Booking Flow

Here's how a customer booking works end-to-end:

```
Customer visits your product page
        ↓
Booking widget loads and shows available dates/times
        ↓
Customer selects service, date, time, and party size
        ↓
Widget creates a HOLD (10-min reservation)
        ↓
Customer confirms details (adults/children)
        ↓
Hold converts to a BOOKING
        ↓
Shopify cart is created with the right product variants
        ↓
Customer is redirected to Shopify checkout
        ↓
Customer pays via your Shopify payment provider
        ↓
Confirmation email is sent automatically
```
