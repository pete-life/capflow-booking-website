## KPI Cards

Six key performance indicators shown at the top:

### Total Bookings
The number of confirmed bookings in the period. Includes customer bookings and staff blocks.

### Total Participants
The sum of all party sizes — how many individual people were booked. A booking for a family of 4 counts as 4 participants.

### Occupancy Rate
**Formula:** Consumed capacity / Total available capacity

How full your timeslots are on average. An occupancy rate of 75% means three-quarters of your available slots are being used.

- **Below 50%** — Room to grow. Consider marketing or reducing capacity to create urgency.
- **50–80%** — Healthy utilisation.
- **Above 80%** — Great demand. Consider adding capacity or raising prices.

### Check-in Rate
**Formula:** Checked-in bookings / Total confirmed bookings

What percentage of booked customers actually showed up. Low check-in rates might indicate:
- No-show problems (consider stronger cancellation policies)
- Customers booking "just in case" (consider booking limits)
- Staff not consistently checking people in

### Cancellation Rate
**Formula:** Cancelled bookings / Total bookings (including cancelled)

How many bookings were cancelled. Some cancellation is normal, but high rates might suggest:
- Customers booking too far in advance
- Pricing issues
- Weather sensitivity (outdoor venues)

### Hold Conversion Rate
**Formula:** Holds that became confirmed bookings / Total holds created

How many customers who started the booking process actually completed it. Low conversion might indicate:
- Checkout flow issues
- Price shock at the payment step
- Technical problems with the widget

## Charts

### Bookings Over Time
Area chart showing daily booking and participant counts. Use this to spot:
- Day-of-week patterns (weekends vs. weekdays)
- Growth trends
- Seasonal changes

### Capacity Utilisation
Area chart comparing available capacity vs. consumed capacity over time. The gap between the lines shows unused capacity.

### Member vs. Public
Percentage breakdown of member pool vs. public pool bookings. Helps you understand:
- Whether member capacity allocation is right-sized
- Trends in membership adoption
- If pool release is working effectively

### By Day of Week
Bar chart showing booking distribution across weekdays. Identifies:
- Your busiest days
- Under-utilised days (opportunity for promotions)
- Staffing alignment

### Peak Hours
Bar chart showing occupancy percentage by hour of day. Identifies:
- Your peak hours (consider premium pricing)
- Off-peak hours (consider discounts)
- Staffing needs throughout the day

Breakdown per resource showing:
- Booking count
- Rider count
- Total capacity (sum of all timeslot capacity)
- Consumed capacity
- Occupancy rate %

## Tips

- **Check weekly:** Review the 7-day view at least once a week to spot trends
- **Compare periods:** Use "This Month vs Last Month" to track growth
- **Watch occupancy:** If consistently above 80%, consider expanding capacity
- **Monitor conversion:** A drop in hold conversion rate often indicates a technical issue
- **Export monthly:** Keep CSV exports for year-over-year comparisons
- **Filter by resource:** If you have multiple resources, analyse each one separately — they may have very different patterns
