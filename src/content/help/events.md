Events let you create special one-off activities outside your regular booking schedule — competitions, workshops, member-only sessions, and more.

**Location:** Sidebar > Events

## What Are Events?

Events are separate from your regular timeslot bookings. They're designed for:
- Competitions and tournaments
- Workshops and clinics
- Member-only sessions
- Seasonal special events
- Private group bookings

Events have their own capacity, pricing, and access restrictions.

## Creating an Event

1. Go to **Events** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Event**
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Event name (e.g., "Summer Competition 2025") |
| **Description** | Details shown to customers |
| **Event Type** | Category (e.g., "Competition", "Workshop") |
| **Start / End** | Date and time |
| **Capacity** | Maximum attendees |
| **Price** | Cost per person (leave empty for free events) |
| **Resource** | Optionally reserve a resource for this event |
| **Blocks Regular Bookings** | Whether regular timeslots are blocked during the event |
| **Access** | Who can attend (see below) |
| **Published** | Whether the event is visible to customers |

---

## Access Restrictions

Control who can book your event:

| Access Level | Who can book |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Open to all** | Anyone |
| **Members Only** | Customers with any active membership |
| **Annual Pass** | Only Annual Pass holders |
| **Clip Card** | Only Clip Card holders |

---

## Blocking Regular Bookings

When **"Blocks regular bookings"** is checked:
- Regular timeslots during the event period are blocked
- Customers can't make regular bookings during that time
- Existing bookings are NOT automatically cancelled (you should handle those separately)

When unchecked:
- Regular bookings continue as normal alongside the event
- The event's capacity is separate from timeslot capacity

**Example:** A competition from 10:00–16:00 that blocks regular bookings means no one can book regular sessions during those hours.

---

## Resource Reservation

Optionally link an event to a specific resource:
- The event appears on that resource's calendar
- Capacity for that resource is affected during the event
- Other resources remain unaffected

If no resource is linked, the event is standalone and doesn't affect regular resource capacity.

---

## Draft vs. Published

- **Draft** — Event exists but isn't visible to customers. Use this to prepare events before announcing them.
- **Published** — Event is visible and bookable (if it has capacity and hasn't passed).

---

## Managing Events

### Filtering
- Filter by **event type** to find specific categories
- Toggle **Show past events** to see historical events

### Viewing Attendance
Click an event to see:
- Current bookings and attendance count
- Customer details
- Remaining capacity

---

## Tips

- **Use event types** consistently for easy filtering (e.g., always "Workshop" not sometimes "workshop")
- **Create events as drafts** first, then publish when you're ready to take bookings
- **Block regular bookings** for events that need the entire venue
- **Set prices to 0** for member-appreciation events or community gatherings
- **Check capacity** a few days before the event and adjust if needed
