        <p>
          CapFlow Booking App ("we", "our", or "the App") is a booking and reservation
          management system that integrates with Shopify stores. This privacy policy
          explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our App.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When integrated with a Shopify store, the App accesses and stores:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customer information</strong>: Name and email address associated with bookings</li>
          <li><strong>Booking data</strong>: Reservation dates, times, party size, and service selections</li>
          <li><strong>Order information</strong>: Order ID, payment status, and line items from Shopify</li>
          <li><strong>Product data</strong>: Product and variant information used for booking services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manage reservations and track capacity availability</li>
          <li>Process bookings and connect them to Shopify orders</li>
          <li>Enable merchants to view and manage customer bookings</li>
          <li>Facilitate check-in and attendance tracking</li>
          <li>Generate booking reports and analytics for merchants</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          All data is stored on secure servers hosted by Fly.io in the European Union.
          We implement industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections
          (HTTPS), secure database access, and regular security updates.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, rent, or share customer data with third parties. Data is only
          accessible to the merchant who operates the Shopify store where the App is installed.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Booking and customer data is retained for as long as the App remains installed
          on the merchant's store, plus a reasonable period for business records (typically
          2 years). When the App is uninstalled, associated data is deleted within 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          As data is stored in the EU and we process data for EU-based merchants,
          we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Merchants
          act as data controllers for their customer data, while we act as a
          data processor.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          If you are a customer who has made a booking through a store using this App,
          you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data by
          contacting the merchant directly. The merchant can fulfill these requests through
          the App's admin interface.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify merchants
          of significant changes through the App or via email.
        </p>
